# Overview
SAR is a type of **active senso**r which produces its own energy and records the energy reflected from the Earth

.pull-left[- Advantages:
  - High resolution
  - Independent of weather condition
  - Capability to penetrate clouds & vegetation


- Limitation:
  - Speckle noise - difficult to interpret the images
  - Limited temporal resolution
  - Dependence on antenna size

# Studies on the Application of SAR
### * P-band of SAR is positively linked to forest biomass (Le Toan et al, 1992)
### * The potential of SAR and InSAR data for hazard mapping (Wiesmann et al, 2001)
### * L-band SAR images provide a robust and direct calculation of glacier motion (Strozzi, 2008)  
### * Dominant Ocean Wavelength and Direction can be detected by SAR (Alpers et al, 1981)

# Reflection

### SAR can obtain high-resolution data from a wide range of regions regardless of weather conditions as it collects data at longer wavelengths. However, I wonder whether there is a difference in images' resolution compared to those obtained at visible wavelengths 


### Furthermore, given that the radar is being used to monitor environmental hazards, could it be also used to monitor and assess the old infrastructre within the built-environment? The infrastructure assessment by using SAR could be cost- and time-efficient than physical investigation
